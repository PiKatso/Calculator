<!-- Create a website with a form on it to take the user's full name and address as if they were ordering a product from you. After they submit the form you should show them a receipt. Thank them for purchasing whatever it is you are selling, and be sure to use their full name. Then, reprint their address as a confirmation of shipping details.

Add CSS to your online store to make it look more professional, or inviting. Or add a stylistic theme that matches whatever your store is selling.

Collect additional information from the user in your form. For instance, if your online marketplace sells jewelry, include form fields denoting whether they're ordering a bracelet, necklace, or earrings. Then, make sure to include this extra information in the receipt you display back to the user. -->
